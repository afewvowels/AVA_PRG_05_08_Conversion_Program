 * Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in meters. The
 * program will then present the following menu of selections:
 * 
 *      1. Convert to kilometers
 *      2. Convert to inches
 *      3. Convert to feet
 *      4. Quit the program
 * 
 * The program will convert the distance to kilometers, inches, or feet
 * depending on the user's selection. Here are the specific requirements:
 * 
 *      * Write a void method named showKilometers, which accepts a number of
 *      meters as an argument. The method should display the argument
 *      converted to kilometers. Convert the meters to kilometers using the
 *      following formula:
 * 
 *          kilometers = meters * 0.001
 * 
 *      * Write a void method named showInches, which accepts a number of
 *      meters as an argument. The method should display the argument
 *      converted to inches. Convert the meters to inches using the
 *      following formula:
 * 
 *          inches = meters * 39.37
 * 
 *      * Write a void method named showFeet, which accepts a number of
 *      meters as an argument. The method should display the argument
 *      converted to feet. Convert the meters to feet using the
 *      following formula:
 *  
 *          feet = meters * 3.281
 * 
 *      * Write a void method named menu that displays a menu of selections.
 *      This method should not accept any arguments.
 *      
 *      * The program should continue to display the menu until the user enters
 *      4 to quit the program.
 * 
 *      * The program should not accept negative numbers for the distance in
 *      meters.
 * 
 *      * If the user selects an invalid choice from the menu, the program
 *      should display an error message.
 * 
 *      Here is an example session with the program, using console input. The
 *      user's input is shown in bold.
 * 
 *          Enter a distance in meters: 500 [Enter]
 *          1. Convert to kilometers
 *          2. Convert to inches
 *          3. Convert to feet
 *          4. Quit the program
 * 
 *          Enter your choice: 1 [Enter]
 *          500 meters is 0.5 kilometers.
 * 
 *          1. Convert to kilometers
 *          2. Convert to inches
 *          3. Convert to feet
 *          4. Quit the program
 * 
 *          Enter your choice: 3 [Enter]
 *          500 meters is 1640.5 feet.
 * 
 *          1. Convert to kilometers
 *          2. Convert to inches
 *          3. Convert to feet
 *          4. Quit the program
 * 
 *          Enter your choice: 4 [Enter]
 *          Bye!
